goPMC

This package consists of interfaces and dynamic link libraries (dll) of a Monte Carlo 
simulation engine for proton therapy, goPMC. The binaries were built with Visual Studio 
2013 in debug x64 configuration. Undefined behavior may occur when different compilers 
or configurations are used.

System requirements:
OpenCL 1.1 or higher.
CPU/GPU supporting OpenCL.

Subdirectories:
include: 
	goPMC.h: goPMC interface.
	cl.hpp: c++ wrapper for OpenCL 1.1.
bin:
	dcmtk.dll(.lib) and libDicomRT.dll(.lib): Libraries for reading and processing Dicom CT data.
	goPMC.dll(.lib): goPMC library.
input: Physics input data.
